## Advent of Code Repos from 2015-
- Started in 2023 and backfilled when interest struck.
- Primarily written in python but other languages might be added for fun.
- When in doubt run a python script with the command `python {FILE_NAME} -h` to determine if any additional arguments are needed.
  * Most commonly would be `python {FILE_NAME} -f {PATH_TO_PUZZLE_FILE}`
